Finding Orders
==============

A critical step to the reduction of HRS data is finding orders in the images.
Typically, images of flat fields or of a bright object can be used to identify
orders in the frame.   The data must first be processed.   Unfortunately, a
truly perfect data set for the identification of the orders is rarely 
available as the response function across the CCD can widely vary. 

Below we outline some tasks that can be used for identifying orders in HRS
images and the steps that are used to process the data to make the 
identification possible. 


Creating an Order Frame from a flatfield
----------------------------------------

An Order Frame is an image where each order has been identified and given 
a number corresponding to its order.   


Fitting functions to the Orders
-------------------------------



Predicting the place of the Orders
----------------------------------

Using a complete optical model for the spectrograph, the position of the orders
could also be predicted.  However, this has not been implimented.
